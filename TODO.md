# TODOs
## Player
- The ship should be able to thrust.
	- Thrust will accelerate the ship “forward” in the direction that it is facing.

## Bullets
- Add bullets.
- The player ship will fire in the direction that it is facing.
- Bullets will disappear after a short while.

## Asteroids
- Create three sizes of asteroids.
- Asteroids will break into smaller asteroids when shot (The smallest will disappear when shot).
- Asteroids will drift around until they are shot or they collide with the player.
	- If the player collides with an asteroid, they will lose a life.

## General
- Enable screen wrapping. (Objects leaving the top of the screen should enter the bottom, for example)

## UI
- Add menus and UI.

## Settings
- Save and load settings

## SFX
- Add sound effects and particle effects.

## Stretch Goals
- Add a flying saucer that enters the screen and shoots at the player from time to time. The saucer should generally aim towards the player, but shouldn’t have too good of aim!
- Add a “hyperspace warp” that moves the player to a random part of the screen. The warp is a last-ditch attempt to dodge an asteroid, but it could place you in a worse predicament!
- Make it your own - This is a great game to add some custom power-ups to.
